# Backbone.Intercept

[![Travis Build Status](http://img.shields.io/travis/jmeas/backbone.intercept.svg?style=flat)](https://travis-ci.org/jmeas/backbone.intercept)

Backbone.Intercept lets you stop writing `e.preventDefault()` in your DOM event callbacks.

### About

The default action of form submissions and link clicks is often undesirable in Backbone applications. One would usually rather handle these events in Backbone.history, and maybe also in a callback specified on a Router. Backbone doesn't prevent
the default action of these DOM events, but Backbone.Intercept does.

If you're writing `e.preventDefault()` in many of your view's event callbacks – or otherwise handling this problem on a per-view
basis – then Backbone.Intercept might be what you're looking for.

```js
// before Backbone.Intercept
var MyView = Backbone.View.extend({
  events: {
    'click a': 'onClick',
    'submit form': 'onSubmit'
  },

  onClick: function(e) {
    e.preventDefault();
    // link click logic
  },

  onSubmit: function(e) {
    e.preventDefault();
    // form submit logic
  }
});

// after Backbone.Intercept
var MyView = Backbone.View.extend({
  events: {
    'click a': 'onClick',
    'submit form': 'onSubmit'
  },

  onClick: function(e) {
    // link click logic
  },

  onSubmit: function(e) {
    // form submit logic
  }
});
```

## Installation

Install through `bower` or `npm`.

```js
bower install backbone.intercept
npm install backbone.intercept
```

## Getting Started

Getting started is easy. Simply call `Backbone.Intercept.start()` when your application is started up. If
you're using Marionette, this might look something like

```js
app.on('start', Backbone.Intercept.start);
```

### Links

#### Default Behavior

For the most part, links with relative URIs will be intercepted, whereas absolute URIs will be ignored by Backbone.Intercept.
Let's look at a few examples to get a better sense of this default behavior.

```js
// The following URIs will be intercepted
'path/to/my-page';
'/absolute/path/to/my-page';
'www.my-website.com';

// The following URIs will be ignored by Backbone.Intercept and handled like normal
'http://www.my-site.com';
'#my-page-fragment';
'mailto:stacy@email.com';
'javascript:void';
```

#### Navigation

By default your intercepted links will be sent along to `Backbone.history.navigate` to be processed. You can customize this
by overriding the `navigate` method on Backbone.Intercept. By doing this, you could make Intercept work with a Router instead,
or integrate other libraries like [Backbone.Radio](https://github.com/marionettejs/backbone.radio).

```js
// Create a Router
var myRouter = new Backbone.Router();

// Attach it to Intercept
Backbone.Intercept.navigate = function(uri, options) {
  myRouter.navigate(uri, options);
};

// Or use a Backbone.Radio Channel
Backbone.Intercept.navigate = function(uri, options) {
  var routerChannel = Backbone.Radio.channel('router');
  routerChannel.command('navigate', uri, options);
};
```

If you don't want anything to happen when you click links you can specify the `navigate` function as a falsey value,
or an empty function.

```js
// Nothing happens when I click links now
Backbone.Intercept.navigate = undefined;
```

#### Customizing the Behavior Per-Link

This behavior can be changed by setting custom attributes on the element.

```html
<!-- Force this link to be ignored by Backbone.Intercept -->
<a href='path/to/my-document.pdf' bypass></a>

<!-- If you want to follow the HTML5 spec, then this version works, too -->
<a href='path/to/my-document.pdf' data-bypass></a>

<!-- You can also be explicit, though this isn't necessary -->
<a href='path/to/my-document.pdf' bypass='true'></a>

<!-- If you've specified a navigateWith property, you can specify the trigger as an attribute -->
<a href='path/to/my-document.pdf' trigger='false'></a>

<!-- There's an HTML5-compliant version for that as well -->
<a href='path/to/my-document.pdf' data-trigger='false'></a>
```

#### Setting Global Link Trigger Behavior

You can set the default trigger behavior by specifying it directly on Backbone.Intercept.

```js
// Let's set the trigger setting to false by default
Backbone.Intercept.trigger = false;
```

### Forms

Forms are much simpler than links. All forms are intercepted unless the `action` attribute has been specified. And unlike links, there's
no integration of forms with a Router.

```html
<!-- This form will be intercepted -->
<form></form>

<!-- But this one will not -->
<form action='post'></form>
```

## API

### Properties

##### `VERSION`

The version of Backbone.Intercept.

##### `trigger`  
default: `true`

The default value of the `trigger` option that's ultimately passed along to the Router's `navigate` method. The value
of the `trigger` or `data-trigger` attribute on the anchor tag itself will always trump this value.

### Methods

##### `start( [options] )`

Starts Backbone.Intercept. You can pass options to turn off either link or form interception.

```js
// In this app we will only intercept forms
Backbone.Intercept.start({
  links: false
});

// And in this one only links
Backbone.Intercept.start({
  forms: false
});
```

##### `stop()`

Stop intercepting links and forms.

##### `navigate( uri, options )`  
default: `Backbone.history.navigate`

A method that's called when links are intercepted. By default it just forwards it along to `Backbone.history.navigate`, but you
can specify a custom method to do whatever you'd like.

The uri is the value of the link's `href` attribute. `options` are the navigation options, which is just an object
with a `trigger` property.
